## TODOs:
    * -- ~~The default summarizing strategy is going to be a simple voting system.~~
    * -- The agents should be able to inherit strategies from axelrod strategies and modify/re-use them.
    * -- ~~implement a framework for a generic summarizing strategy that can be implemented by future users.~~
    * -- Create a spatial area and a game with neighbourship in some specific area, and some natural probabilistic growth of resources in the area as the source of sustenance for the players. think Conway's game of life if it helps
